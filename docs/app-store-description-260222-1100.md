**Strata - Personal Task Manager for Multi-Project Professionals**

One app. Multiple projects. Zero data leaks.

**Strata** is the personal task manager built for professionals who juggle multiple projects across different companies. Freelancers, consultants, side-hustlers—this is your command center for managing everything without mixing company data.

---

**WHY STRATA?**

You work across Jira, Monday, Asana, Trello, and more. Each company has their system. But you need YOUR system—one place to see all your tasks, deadlines, and commitments across every project.

Strata gives you that overview. Your personal layer above the corporate tools. Independent. Private. Yours.

---

**BUILT FOR MULTITASKERS**

• **Track Multiple Projects** - Organize tasks by client, company, or project
• **Smart Tags** - Create tags for each project (e.g., #ClientA, #SideProject, #Urgent). One tap filters all related tasks instantly.
• **AI-Enhanced Capture** - Rough notes become clear tasks. BYOK support for Gemini, z.ai.
• **Priority Across Projects** - See what's urgent across ALL your work
• **Timeline View** - Visualize deadlines across multiple commitments
• **Filter by Context** - "What do I owe Client A?" "What's due this week across everything?"

**💡 Pro Tip:** Use tags as your project layers. Tag tasks with client names, project codes, or work types—then filter with one click to see everything for that context.

---

**INSTANT CAPTURE**

Press ⌘⇧N from anywhere to capture a task. No context switching. Whether you're in Slack, Figma, or a Zoom meeting—capture the thought instantly.

Quick Entry Panel:
• Task title and description
• Due date and reminders
• Priority (None → Critical)
• Project tags
• Photo attachments

---

**AI-ENHANCED CLARITY**

Rough notes become clear action items:

• **Correct Me** - Fix grammar, improve clarity
• **Enhance Prompt** - Transform rough ideas into detailed, prompt-ready descriptions. Perfect for AI power users who craft prompts for a living.
• **Explain** - Analyze images and documents
• **Custom Modes** - Create your own enhancement styles for your unique workflow

**⌨️ Inline Enhance (Premium)** - Press ⌘⌥E in ANY app to enhance text in-place. Like Grammarly, but with your AI models. Select text in Mail, Notes, Safari, or any app → enhance instantly → replaced inline. No copy-paste, no context switching.

**BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** - Use your own API key from Gemini, z.ai, or any compatible provider. You control costs, you choose models, you own your data. Nothing sent to us.

---

**LOCAL-FIRST PRIVACY**

Your work data is sensitive. Client names, project details, deadlines. Strata keeps it secure:

• **100% Local Storage** - All data lives on YOUR Mac
• **iCloud Sync** - Optional sync via your private iCloud (iOS app coming soon!)
• **No Cloud Servers** - We never see your data
• **No Account Required** - No email, no sign-up, no tracking
• **Secure API Keys** - Stored in macOS Keychain

This is YOUR task manager. Not another SaaS mining your workflow data.

**📱 iOS App Coming Soon** - Take your tasks everywhere. Same tags, same projects, same privacy—synced seamlessly via your iCloud.
